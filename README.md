# doors98 🚪
Microsoft Windows 98 replication made in JavaScript. ☕️✨

This project aims to replicate all the base functionality of Windows 98 as accurately as possible.
I'v tried to even replicate the lag-ness typical of old hardware.
This project is made just for fun and for aesthetic purposes.

dead for now.
When I'll get some spare free time, I'll start working on it again.
